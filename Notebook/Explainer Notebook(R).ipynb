    "#### What is your dataset?\n",
    "Our dataset is '311 Service Requests' from NYC OpenData, it is a dataset which contains all the complaints from anybody who call 311 or use their app. The types of complaints can be almost anything; dead animals, illegal parking, noise, and even complaints about plumbing or missing paint in a rented apartment. \n",
    "#### Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?\n",
    "We choose the '311 Service Requests' because it is a very divers dataset with many different problems which we can analyze and compare.\n",
    "#### What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",

Further more we removed the cases which wasn't closed, the combined effort decreased our amount of rows to **2.022.409**.     \n",
